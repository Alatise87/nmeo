# New Methods in Earth Observation

## Overview
This course is a skills-based seminar focused on new methods, software, and sensors used to overcome key limitations facing Earth Observation (EO). In this course, students will work, within the broader context of several active research projects, on developing and applying several specific EO methods including: 

- Scaling-up crop growth and productivity estimates derived from automated _in situ_ sensors and UAS imagery up to smallsats; 
- Processing imagery using cloud-based computational platforms, such as Google Earth Engine.
- An active learning approach (combining crowdsourcing and machine learning) to mapping agricultural land cover;

We will learn a range of new skills, including: 

- Programmatic access to sensor and image-serving APIs, as well as cloud-based earth observation platforms, using Javascript, python, and R; 
- UAS flight planning and image processing with eMotion and PIX4D software.
- Deep learning applications using Google Colab and RadiantEarth.

After an initial introduction to the various toolsets we will be using, students will form project teams (~2-4 people each) to tackle further development and application of one of the three project areas. These projects (described [here](docs/projects.md) in more detail) will be assessed by means of a formal in-class presentation and team-authored final project.
