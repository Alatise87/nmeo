## Review of previous class
- Drones and scaling 
- PIX4d questions

## Analyzing Drone Orthomosaics

#### eMotion/flight correction
#### Examine PIX4D outputs
#### Exercises using `R`, `gdal`, and `leaflet` to examine the drone orthomosaics we created for homework. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;+ Requires working `R`, Rstudio, `gdal` installs, and changing a few parameters 

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ If that fails, ArcGIS/Terrset/QGIS as a substitute

---
### Open PIX4D
#### Create new project
##### - Name it something related to the eMotion3 project name

--

#### Add images 
##### - Select the "msp" directory from the eMotion3 project folder you just created (under an img sub-folder), click next, and it will upload the images. 

--

##### - The imported images include any reflectance target images that were taken. 

--

##### - These images should be excluded if you don't want PIX4D to calculate reflectance from the targets. 

--

##### - To do that, you can either choose to import photos by using the "Add images" dialog, and leaving out the calibration images from the dataset (they are the first 12 images by timestamp in our sample datasets).  The other way we will see in a little while. 

--

##### - Once images are imported, click next and next through defaults, until you arrive at the Processing Options Template. Choose the Ag Multispectral template, and click finish.

---

#### Choose post-processing options 

You will see an image that looks like the one below now. Click the "Processing Options Button at the Bottom", which will pop up a dialog.

![](figures/02/pix4d_view.png)

---

The dialog lists

#### *1. Initial processing* 
#### *2. Point cloud and mesh*
#### *3. DSM, orthomosaic, and index*

---

##### - Leave *initial processing* as is

--

##### - Under *Point cloud and mesh*'s Point Cloud tab, select "Classify Point Cloud", "LAS" (under export), and "Merge Tiles into One File"

--

##### - Under *DSM, orthomosaic, and index*, the settings you should select for the first two tabs (DSM and Orthomosaic and Additional Outputs) should like the images in the next two slides 


---

![](figures/02/dsm_ortho.png)

---

![](figures/02/add_settings.png)

---

##### - The Index Calculator tab should look like this (uncheck the two export options at bottom)

![](figures/02/index.png)

---

##### - Now, under the Radiometric Processing and Calibration tabs, here is the second place you can remove the calibration targets, which aren't always detected. If you click "calibrate" under each band, you will see this:

![](figures/02/calibrate.png)

If there is a blue box in there, the software detected the target successfully. It not, you can manually draw in a box.  You can also close the dialog and choose "Reset", to clear the calibration images. When you do this, PIX4d will draw on conversion coefficients that were calculated from the plane's sunshine sensor (as it will do if you choose not to import the calibration images).  

---

### Start Processing

![](figures/02/process.png)

It will take a while, but when finished view the results. Check out the Ray Cloud, the Quality Report, and then inspect the actual output reflectance images and the DSM/DTMs. You will find them in the project folder that you named. 

---
## Setup
Working with our Anaconda-installed versions of RStudio, we will have to first install:

#### `gdal` into the Anaconda Rstudio environment
#### in RStudio, in a new script or console prompt::

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("Rcpp")
install.packages("gdalUtils")
install.packages("raster")
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("here")
```

This provides necessary libraries for our analyses

### Open Up eMotion3
#### Set up new mission over Whittier
#### Run simulation
### PIX4D project
#### Quality Reports
#### Ray clouds

# Examining Our Orthomosaic Results

We'll use examples of 2020 imagery to start. 
---
## Starting with Pre-processing

### Preamble: 

We are going to use R and Rstudio to perform these analyses.  These slides provide a walk through of the code and results.  A companion script puts all the code in one place, which you should use so that you can run it more easily.  

### Coding Tips
#### - To execute code, simply highlight the lines you want to run, and then hit Ctrl + Enter (windows) or CMD + Enter (Mac)
#### - Assuming you have all the libraries and `gdal` properly installed, this code should work. The only things you have to change are path settings for files. 
---


## Set up your R code

First you have to set path variables, and load the R packages you need for analysis. The first lines of code are path and name variables, which are the only places where you have to change anything.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Path variables
## You have to replace the paths within the quotes to match: 
# 1. the directory path where you put the PIX4D outputs 
img_path <- "C:/Users/micha/Documents/pix4d"

# 2. The folder names for each of the projects. 
# !!!NOTE!!!: this assumes you put all four PIX4D project folders in one common # directory. Please move them into one if you didn't do so.
project1 <- "whittier_03aug20_pix4d"
project2 <- "whittier_03aug20_ppk_without_refl_cal"
project3 <- "whittier_03aug20_nonppk_norefl"
project4 <- "whittier_10aug20_ppk_without_refl_cal"

# 3. the directory where you want your outputs to be written 
out_dir <- "C:/Users/micha/Documents/geog287387_s2021/materials/data/05"  

# 4. the directory containing reflectance images in your projects. 
# If you only created tile outputs, your results will live in 
# .../4_index/reflectance/tiles/". If so, set the value to "tiles". If you have # merged outputs, they you will images in 4_index/reflectance/, so set the variable to "merged". In my case, they are merged, so I chose "merged"
ref_dir <- "merged"

# 5. path to companion class5_functions.R script
script_path <- "C:/Users/micha/Documents/geog287387_s2021/materials/code/R/uas_image_functions.R"

```

---

The next lines can be changed, but these are optional

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## The following variables are optional to change. These are the name roots for 
#  each of the images will we be creating. 
mband1 <- "aug03_ngb"
mband2 <- "aug03_ngb_noreftarget"
mband3 <- "aug03_ngb_noppk"
mband4 <- "aug10_ngb_noreftarget"

# Output names for warped and stretched
out1 <- "aug03_ngb_cog"
out2 <- "aug03_ngb_noreftarget_cog"
out3 <- "aug03_ngb_noppk_cog"
out4 <- "aug10_ngb_noreftarget_cog"
```

Then load in the packages and functions we will need
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(gdalUtils)
library(raster)
library(here)
source(script_path)  # this loads the companion scripts
```

---

### Exercise 1 

#### - An initial look at August 03 orthomosaic reflectance for permutation 1, with reflectance targets and PPK correction.  

##### - Run this code

Replace the path in `p` with the directory string for the project directory on your computer.  After replacing this, run this chunk of code
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# This reads the path to the four reflectance maps
fp <- file.path(img_path, project1)
img_nms <- refl_paths(fp)

# This creates a stack of the NIR, Red, Green bands, and then plots them in R
s <- stack(lapply(img_nms[c(2, 4, 1)], raster))
plotRGB(s, scale = 1, zlim = c(0, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/aug03_1.png"), height = 600, width = 600)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plotRGB(s, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), bgalpha = 0)
dev.off()
```
You should see something that looks like this

---

![](figures/05/aug03_1.png)
---

Now let's make a multi-band stack of the images, drawing on a customized function that relies on gdal, called `multi_band_stack`, which takes 3 arguments: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ `nms`, the paths to the reflectance bands. We want just NIR, Red, Green.

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ `out_dir`, the path to the output directory you select

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ `out_name`, the root base name (no extension) for the stacked geotiff


```{r, eval = FALSE}
nms <- img_nms[c(2, 4, 1)]  
b1 <- multi_band_stack(nms = nms, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = mband1)
plotRGB(b1, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1))
```

---

Okay, let's convert the other 3 projects to multi-band stacks

August 03, PPK, no reflectance target
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fp <- file.path(img_path, project2)
img_nms <- refl_paths(fp)
nms <- img_nms[c(2, 4, 1)]  
b2 <- multi_band_stack(nms = nms, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = mband2)
plotRGB(b2, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/aug03_2.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plotRGB(b2, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), bgalpha = 0)
dev.off()
```

![](figures/05/aug03_2.png)

---

August 03, no PPK, no reflectance target
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fp <- file.path(img_path, project3)
img_nms <- refl_paths(fp)
nms <- img_nms[c(2, 4, 1)]
b3 <- multi_band_stack(nms = nms, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = mband3)
plotRGB(b3, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/aug03_3.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plotRGB(b3, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), bgalpha = 0)
dev.off()
```

![](figures/05/aug03_3.png)


---

August 10, PPK, no reflectance target
```{r, eval = FALSE}
fp <- file.path(img_path, project4)
img_nms <- refl_paths(fp)
nms <- img_nms[c(2, 4, 1)]
b4 <-  multi_band_stack(nms = nms, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = mband4)
plotRGB(b4, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/aug10_1.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plotRGB(b4, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), bgalpha = 0)
dev.off()
```

![](figures/05/aug10_1.png) 


---

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ext <- apply(do.call(rbind, lapply(list(b1, b2, b3), sf::st_bbox)), 2, min)
ext <- as(extent(ext[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]), "SpatialPolygons")
proj4string(ext) <- proj4string(b1)
ext <- spTransform(ext, "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs")
```

Now we are going to process the different images so that we can perform bandmath on them. 

This entails using another custom function that calls `gdalwarp`:

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ reprojects to WGS84

&nbsp;&nbsp;+ aligns images to same extent

This is the extent we are using, so run this

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ext <- c(-71.8101, 42.1193, -71.8041, 42.1242)
```

And now let's process the first image stack

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b1a <- img_align(img = b1@file@name, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = out1, 
                 ext = ext)
```

And have a look at it

---

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plotRGB(b1a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/aug03_warp1.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plotRGB(b1a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), bgalpha = 0)
dev.off()
```
![](figures/05/aug03_warp1.png)

---

Let's do the rest now

```{r, eval = FALSE}
b2a <- img_align(img = b2@file@name, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = out2, 
                 ext = ext)
b3a <- img_align(img = b3@file@name, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = out3, 
                 ext = ext)
b4a <- img_align(img = b4@file@name, out_dir = out_dir, out_name = out4, 
                 ext = ext)
```

# Comparisons

## Reflectance calibration strategy

How much difference? Let's visualize with a bit of band math

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ref_diff <- b1a - b2a  # subtract no ref target from ref target

# plot the difference maps, per band
nms <- c("NIR", "Red", "Green")
plot(ref_diff, main = nms, axes = FALSE, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5))  
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/ref_diff.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plot(ref_diff, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5), 
     axis.args = list(col = "white", col.axis = "white"))
dev.off()
```

![](figures/05/ref_diff.png) 

---
How much difference in stats?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
stats <- cellStats(ref_diff, summary)
colnames(stats) <- nms
round(stats, 3)
```

---

## PPK versus not

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ref_diff <- b2a - b3a  # subtract no ref target from ref target
plot(ref_diff, main = nms, axes = FALSE, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5))
stats <- cellStats(ref_diff, summary)
colnames(stats) <- nms
round(stats, 3)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/ref_diff2.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plot(ref_diff, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5), 
     axis.args = list(col = "white", col.axis = "white"))
dev.off()
```

![](figures/05/ref_diff2.png)

---

## Two different dates

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ref_diff <- b2a - b4a  # subtract no ref target from ref target
plot(ref_diff, main = nms, axes = FALSE, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5))
stats <- cellStats(ref_diff, summary)
colnames(stats) <- nms
round(stats, 3)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/ref_diff3.png"), height = 400, width = 400)
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), bg = "transparent")
plot(ref_diff, zlim = c(-0.5, 0.5), 
     axis.args = list(col = "white", col.axis = "white"))
dev.off()
```

## Effective Resolution

How much shift between PPK strategies?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ext <- c(-71.80825, 42.120780, -71.807550, 42.121566)
pt <- cbind(mean(ext[c(1, 3)]), mean(ext[c(2, 4)]))
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(as(extent(ext[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]), "SpatialPolygons"), lty = 0)
plotRGB(b2a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), add = TRUE)
points(pt[, 1], pt[, 2], col = "cyan", pch = "+")
plot(as(extent(ext[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]), "SpatialPolygons"), lty = 0)
plotRGB(b3a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), add = TRUE)
points(pt[, 1], pt[, 2], col = "cyan", pch = "+")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
png(here("materials/slides/figures/05/spat_diff.png"), height = 300, width = 500)
ext <- c(-71.80825, 42.120780, -71.807550, 42.121566)
pt <- cbind(mean(ext[c(1, 3)]), mean(ext[c(2, 4)]))
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), mfrow = c(1, 2), bg = "transparent")
plot(as(extent(ext[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]), "SpatialPolygons"), lty = 0)
plotRGB(b2a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), add = TRUE)
points(pt[, 1], pt[, 2], col = "cyan", pch = "+")
plot(as(extent(ext[c(1, 3, 2, 4)]), "SpatialPolygons"), lty = 0)
plotRGB(b3a, scale = 1, colNA = "transparent", zlim = c(0, 1), add = TRUE)
points(pt[, 1], pt[, 2], col = "cyan", pch = "+")
dev.off()
```

## Assignment 1

Pix4D allows us to create mosaics with and without reflectance calibration.

We want to see if reflectance calibration has a larger effect for images on July 21 (cloudy skies) or August 03 (clear skies).


---
## Assignment 1

On the class share, you will find the Pix4D outputs for August 3. There are two sets of images, one that is PPK corrected with reflectance calibration, and one ha is PPK corrected without reflectance calibration.

![](figures/02/uas_slides/UAS workflow_aug03_images.png) 

---
## Assignment 1

For the July 21 images, the PPK corrected images are on the class share. However, these images have not been processed in Pix4D. You will need to process these images twice in Pix4D, once with reflecance calibration, and once without reflectance calibration.
