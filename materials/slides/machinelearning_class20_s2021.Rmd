---
## Schedule
- Tuesday (May 4). Check-in on project ideas
- Thursday (May 6). Proposals due by 4:15 PM (on Slack)
- Project updates (May 18, 25). Short presentations (2-3 slides). Focus on main obstacles.

---
## Final Project due dates
- Video presentation (Weds June 2)
- Final report (Fri June 4)

---
## Proposal
- Written proposal (1/2 - 1 page)
 - What are the goals of the project? (i.e. what do you want to find out/demonstrate?)
 - What methods/tools will you use?
 - What data sets do you have, and what data sets do you still need to find?
 - Provide a list of concrete steps you can take to achieve this project's goals. These steps should be sequential (i.e. first steps are fundamental to project, later steps are "nice-to-have"). If you are in a group, it may be helpful to assign different tasks to group members.
