## Background
- Algorithms of increasing complexity + predictive power
- Machine learning
  - [Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning): 
      - Ability to progressively improve predictions without explicit programming
  - Characteristics:
      - Non-parametric
      - Can predict complex classes
      - Can handle highly dimensioned data
      - More effective than traditional classifiers

## Classes of algorithms

Check out this [nice overview](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y7boyxe4ao2fppo/Computer%20Vision%20Machine%20Learning%20Deep%20Learning.pdf?dl=0) by Luisa and Lei from GEOG391

### Decision trees

- Simple or ensemble (random forest)

### Support Vector Machines
- Optimal plane separating two classes

### Neural networks
- Mimics structure of animals brains
- Artificial neurons connected by "edges" (synapses)
- Hidden layers determine how inputs mapped to outputs
- One output neuron (node) per class

---
## Machine learning and training data

- Need large amounts of training data
- Typically human interpretation of imagery
