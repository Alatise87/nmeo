## Background

- Limits to Earth Observation

![](figures/limits.png)


---

## McCabe et al (2017)

![Figure 1](figures/mccabe_figure_1.jpg)

---

## McCabe et al (2017)

- What are key limitations to EO mentioned in this paper?
 - physical
 - economic
 - institutional
 - knowledge

---

## McCabe et al (2017)
- How does the use of Planet CubeSats overcome these limitations?
- What limitations remain, and what new limitations are introduced?

---

## Background 
Collapsed limits down to:

- Physical 
- Methodological
- Societal

---

## Physical Limits 1

- Space-time tradeoff
- Initiated by conflict between resolution and extent
- [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/kY7wsSeIkMY?t=1008) by Middlebury RS
 - SNR = signal-to-noise ratio 
 - IFOV = instantaneous field of view

---

## Physical Limits 2

- Temporal: length of record

---

## Physical limits 3

- Surface characteristics: terrain and vegetation
- Atmosphere
- Perspective

---

## Methodological Limits

- Inadequate models: 
    - Need these to solve the inverse problem 
    - Models outpaced by EO data
- Not enough cal/val data
- Competing standards

---

## Societal Limits
- Expertise barrier
- Institutional limitations
    - Data access and collection policies
    - Coordination
- Accessibility to methods
- Collection biases

## The Combined Effect of Limits

## Innovation Pushing Back Limits 1

- More Eyes in the Sky

library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
img1 <-  rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("figures/01/b&s_fig8.png")),
                    interpolate = FALSE)
img2 <-  rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("figures/01/radtke_fig1.png")), 
                    interpolate = FALSE)
grid.arrange(img1, img2, ncol = 2)
```

## Limits Addressed

- Physical:
    - Space-time tradeoff mitigated: 
        - Resolution versus extent
        - Atmospheric interference
    - Terrain effects (more radar)
    - Perspective (more radar and lidar)
- Societal:
    - Accessibility (cheaper)

---

## Whittier Farms image comparison

- Open "whittier_comparison.R" in materials --> code --> R 
- This likely won't work yet, but you can follow along




---

## Multispectral sensor comparison

- In groups, open the "Multispectral sensor comparison sheet"
- Your group is assigned a sensor. Try to fill out the sheet!
- Your answer may be "it depends", this is OK! Try to explain what your answer depends on




---

## Multispectral sensor comparison

- How well would your group's sensor be used for the following applications?
 - Precision irrigation for vineyards  
 - Mapping forest fire burn areas
 - Mapping smallholder agriculture productivity (small, irregular shaped fields) at a  (state/district) scale
 - Mapping national crop productivity over multiple years
