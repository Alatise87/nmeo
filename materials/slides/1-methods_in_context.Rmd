## Introduction
- Today: 
  - Course introduction
  - Housekeeping: computing, class, etc
  - Background and introduction

---

## Overview of EO Limits

- Physical 
- Methodological
- Societal

---

## Physical Limits 1

- Space-time tradeoff
- Initiated by conflict between resolution and extent

---

## Physical Limits 2

- Temporal: length of record

---

## Physical limits 3

- Surface characteristics: terrain and vegetation
- Atmosphere
- Perspective

---

## Methodological Limits

- Inadequate models: 
    - Need these to solve the inverse problem 
    - Models outpaced by EO data
- Not enough cal/val data
- Competing standards

---

## Societal Limits
- Expertise barrier
- Institutional limitations
    - Data access and collection policies
    - Coordination
- Accessibility to methods
- Collection biases

---

## The Combined Effect of Limits

## Innovation Pushing Back Limits 1

- More Eyes in the Sky

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Left: max. resolution versus year of launch (Belward & Sk√∏ien, 2015), Right: number of launches (Radtke et al, 2017) "}
library(png)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
img1 <-  rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("figures/02/b&s_fig8.png")),
                    interpolate = FALSE)
img2 <-  rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG("figures/02/radtke_fig1.png")), 
                    interpolate = FALSE)
grid.arrange(img1, img2, ncol = 2)
```

## Limits Addressed

- Physical:
    - Space-time tradeoff mitigated: 
        - Resolution versus extent
        - Atmospheric interference
    - Terrain effects (more radar)
    - Perspective (more radar and lidar)
- Societal:
    - Accessibility (cheaper)
