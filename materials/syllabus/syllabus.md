## Overview

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to recent advances
in Earth Observation technology that are leading to breakthroughs in our
ability to make sense of whatâ€™s happening on our planet. Drawing on
material from ongoing research projects, the course focuses primarily on
the following areas:

1.  Cloud-computing/cloud-based EO platforms
2.  Small satellites
3.  UAS/drones
4.  In situ sensor networks
5.  Advanced ML/Deep learning

This semester, we will spend the most time on the first and last areas.

Course learning is drawn from some background reading, brief lectures,
participation and completion of in-class practicals, and a final group
project.
