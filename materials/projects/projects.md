This year we are going to focus on 2-3 potential projects, mostly
involving deep learning/advanced ML.

1.  [Map smallholder field boundaries at country-scale](#project-1)
2.  [Train a model to map crop types in drone data](#project-2)

More detail on each follows:

## Project 1

### Field boundary mapping

The goal of this project is to use advanced machine learning models that
we have developed to [map smallholder-dominated croplands in
Africa](mappingafrica.io), and apply it to map new regions and years.

## Project 2

### Detecting crop types in drone data

As part of a project to develop improved crop analytics for farmers in
Ghana, we have collected an extensive set of UAS imagery, which we will
use to identify crop types. The goal of this project is to see if we can
develop a model to classify the crops visible in the drone imagery.
