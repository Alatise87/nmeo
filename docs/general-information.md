## General information

### Expectations
Since our class is a computer lab, please no food or drink. Class attendance is expected, as is on-time submission of assignments (late submissions require valid justification prior to submission date), and doing all the readings/assignments prior to the class for which they are assigned. 

We follow the University's policies on plagiarism and cheating. Please familiarize yourself with the University's [policy](http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/aac/integrity.cfm) on academic integrity, particularly section I. 

### Communications
We will conduct class communications via a Slack channel that you should already be invited to. Please don't send emails. We use Slack because it keeps relevant conversations in defined places, rather than scattered across email inboxes. 

### Approach
This is a project-oriented class, and the projects map onto ongoing research problems. This means that the course will be hands-on and devoted to developing new methods/analyses from some of the newest tools to hit the EO scenes. The downside is that this means that we are all learning as we go, and there will generally not be step-by-step tutorials or recipes to follow. The upside to that downside is that we will all learn a lot more!
