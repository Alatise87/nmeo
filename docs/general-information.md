## General information

### Expectations
Since our class is a computer lab, please no food or drink. Class attendance is expected, as is on-time submission of assignments (late submissions require valid justification prior to submission date), and doing all the readings/assignments prior to the class for which they are assigned. 

We follow the University's policies on plagiarism and cheating. Please familiarize yourself with the University's [policy](http://www2.clarku.edu/offices/aac/integrity.cfm) on academic integrity, particularly section I. 

### Communications
We will conduct class communications via a Slack channel that you should already be invited to. Please don't send emails. We use Slack because it keeps relevant conversations in defined places, rather than scattered across email inboxes. 

### Approach
This is a project-oriented class, and the projects map onto ongoing research problems. This means that the course will be hands-on and devoted to developing new methods/analyses from some of the newest tools to hit the EO scenes. The downside is that this means that we are all learning as we go, and there will generally not be step-by-step tutorials or recipes to follow. The upside to that downside is that we will all learn a lot more! 

### Assessment

Final letter grades will be assigned as follows:

| Grade Letter | Upper (+)| Middle    | Lower (-) |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
|     A        |    >99   |   93-99   |   90-93   |
|     B        |   88-90  |   83-88   |   80-83   |
|     C        |   78-80  |   73-78   |   70-73   |
|     D/F      |   68-70  |   60-68   |   <60 (F) |

Grades will be based on:

- __Participation__, defined as contribution to discussion and problem-solving, and completion of any assigned materials. This is worth 20% of overall grade.
- __Final presentation__: Representing 40% of the final grade for undergraduates and 30% for graduates.
- __Final paper/report__: 40% of undergraduates' grades, 50% of graduates. 

#### Presentations 
The presentation will be assessed according to the following criteria, which sum to 60 points:

- **Quality** evaluates the _content_ of the material you present related to your project, focusing on the information and ideas conveyed in your presentation. How much did you contribute to the project, and how creatively and thoroughly did you do it (i.e. how hard and how-well did you try to problem-solve)? [30 points]
- **Progress** evaluates whether you achieved the objectives put forward in your project proposal, and assessed against the date of project start [15 points]
- **Clarity** relates to the presentation itself--how clear your slides were (they should show, not tell), and your presentation of the material on them; how closely you stuck to time limits; how well you ordered the presentation and how easy it was to follow [15 points]

_Rubric_

Codes: 

- Assessment sub-categories
  - OM = How well were the objectives/methods/goals of the project understood?
  - CON = How much contributed to project?
  - CRE = Creativity/problem-solving 
  - SLI = How clear/effective were the slides?
  - TIM = How was the presentation's timing? 
  - NAR = Was the narrative clear?
- Modifiers:
  - N = No, None, or Not (as in unclear)
  - NV = Not very, not very much
  - F = Fair, fairly
  - H = Highly, outstanding
  - WLWS = Way too long or way too short
  - TLTS = Too long or too short (2-4 minutes)
  - BLBS = Slighly too long or too short (1-2 minutes)
  - PT = Perfect timing

| Quality | Quality pts| Progress | Progress pts | Clarity | Clarity pts |
|--------------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| OM N, CON N, CRE N | 0 | N | 0 | NAR N, NAR N, TIM WLWS | 0 |
| OM NV, CON NV, CRE NV | 20 | NV | 9 | NAR NV, NAR NV, TIM TLTS | 9  
| OM F, CON F, CRE F | 25 | F | 12 | NAR F, NAR F, TIM BLBS | 12 |
| OM H, CON H, CRE H | 30 | H | 15 |  NAR H, NAR H, TIM PT | 15 |

##### Presentation structure
- Each person's individual presentation time should last no more than **9 minutes**: *6 minutes* of actual presentation, followed by *2-3 minutes* of questions. That means if you are in a group of 4, your total group time should be no more than 36 minutes. 
- Teams should present together, with each person presenting part of the presentation. Questions can be taken after each person goes, or at the end of all members presentations. 
- A rough rule of them that generally works is to have 1 slide prepared per minute of presentation.  
- Slides should be used to help illustrate a point, and should rather have figures than text. Figures should have labels that can be easily read from the furthest seat in the room.
- What should the presentation convey? 
    - What the overall aim of the project is (introduction)
    - What methods you used and why they might be considered "New Methods in Earth Observation". Here you are providing an explainer to your colleagues, who were focusing on different projects and didn't get a chance to delve into the projects you were doing
    - What results you got so far
    - What you plan to achieve by the submission date, and potentially beyond
    - Projects vary in their format and how they were pursued. It might make more sense for each person in a group to try convey some or all of these aspects, or for each member to focus on presenting one or more of these aspects. We can discuss that. 


#### Final paper/report
The purpose of the final paper/report is to provide a working demonstration of the method you have been developing as a group. It should build on the work you already presented in class. It should be submitted as a single project/report, but each member should write the section that describes their contribution, while writing in any common sections can be divided equitably between team members. 

The following provides a working overview of the paper/report structure:

- __Introduction__: A more detailed and informative overview of the project's purpose and objectives than what your provided in assignment 6. Approximate maximum length of 300 words per team member.  

- __Methods__: Provide a complete but brief description of the method you developed, complete with informative illustrations and summaries of the input datasets. Approximate maximum length of 300 words per team member. 

- __Results__: Describe and illustrate your results, using standard scientific reporting conventions: 1) plan on having 1 figure per team member; 2) a similar number of statistical summaries; 3) describe the results in your figures and tables in (up to) 300 words per team member. 

- __Discussion__: Briefly provide your interpretation of the results, any uncertainties/difficulties encountered, and any next steps to be taken. Up to 400 words per team member.

Assessment is out of 60 pts (note that there is a minimum points floor, which assumes that a final project has been submitted), and will be based on three categories: 

- **Quality** evaluates the _content_ of the material in your final method, focusing on the information and ideas conveyed in your descriptions, figures, and tables. How well did you understand and execute the project, and how well did you convey what you did? [30 points]
- **Progress** evaluates whether you achieved the objectives put forward in your project proposal and final presentation, focusing more on the latter due to course corrections (and incorporating any necessary changes we discussed) [15 points]
- **Clarity** examines the clarity of the writing (is it easy to understand, no typos or missed words), the visual aspects of figures (does the color choice make sense, legend sensible, size appropriate, text readable?), formatting (did html lists end up as lists? do headings make sense?), and code syntax. This basically covers the stylistic components of your vignettes and code. [15 points]
