# Team Projects

There are four general subject areas from which projects for this course can be drawn.  

1. Multi-scale estimation of crop LAI
2. Multi-scale estimation of crop yield
3. Using cloud-based EO platforms to create multi-source image time series
4. Mapping land cover using crowdsourcing and machine learning

More detail on each follows:

## Project 1: Maize Leaf Area Index

We have been collecting data over the course of the summer in a maize/corn field at Whittier Farms, in Sutton, MA. Data include:

- Micro-meteorology and crop growth data collected by three Arable Mark sensors
- Field measurements of leaf area index collected underneath each Mark
- 10 cm multi-spectral imagery collected by a Sequioa+ camera mounted on an Ebee Plus UAS on several dates

In addition to these, we can also acquire near-daily PlanetScope 3-4 RGBNIR imagery over the same fields. 

One major goal of this project is to develop estimates of maize leaf area index (LAI) from these multiple sources and understand how these estimates change with scale and extent. To do this, we will: 

- Derive measurements of LAI first from the field measurements; 
- Use these measurements to estimate LAI values from the Marks' spectrometer data, and co-located UAS and PlanetScope image pixels; 
- Apply the UAS and PlanetScope LAI-image relationships to map LAI across the fields at varying resolution; 
- Quantify the discrepancies between the various LAI estimation approaches. 

Along the way, we will make additional use of our Mark data to convert PlanetScope imagery to surface reflectance, perhaps with topographic normalization thrown in for good measure. 

## Project 2: Maize yield

This project is closely related to project 1, in that it will rely in part on the LAI estimates. For this project, we want to: 

- Use the Mark micro-meteorology estimates to run a mechanistic crop simulator to predict maize yields. 
- Use the mechanistic model outputs (including simulated LAI) and a subset of simplified inputs to develop an empirical model of yields.   
- Using these relationships together with remotely-sensed predictors (primarily LAI), we will map predicted yields in ~16-25 m^2^ blocks through the fields.

## Project 3: EO Platforms and High Resolution Image Time Series

One ongoing research need for estimating agricultural productivity is to have a set of imagery that is: 

1. High resolution (<=30 m)
2. High frequency (<1 month return)
3. Covers a number of years. 

New satellite fleets such as those of Planet enable 1 and 2, but not 3, which is necessary for studying changes in productivity over time.  

There are new approaches that allow the fusion of MODIS and Landsat data, where MODIS provides the temporal resolution and Landsat the spatial. Both sets of imagery are available in new cloud-based processing engines such as Google Earth Engine.  

In this project, we aim to develop such a dataset for Zambia, using a new approach such as [STAIR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425718301998) (Luo et al, 2018). 

Related to both this project and Project 1, we may also use an EO platform to process the Planet data we need for Project 1. 

## Project 4: Active Learning
We are developing a new land cover mapping platform that runs on Amazon Web Services virtual machines. The platform is based on active learning, where a machine learning algorithm iteratively tasks human mappers to collect training data in areas of lingering classification uncertainty. The mappers create this training data by digitizing crop fields they identify in high resolution Planet imagery.  

There are three possible projects related to this: 

1. Deploy the active learning framework to a new geography outside of the current target region (Ghana).
2. Apply it to new land cover type.
3. Use the training datasets and imagery collected for Ghana to investigate the impact that training data error has on classification accuracy.
